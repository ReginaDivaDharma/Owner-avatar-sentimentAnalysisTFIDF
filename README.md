# Overview
Within this project i am using TF-IDF as a vectorizer to do sentiment analysis using 5 machine algorithms such as KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and random forest. My objective is to find the best performing machine algorithm to do this task by using a confusion matrix to see their performance. 

# Dataset Used
The dataset used within this project is women's e-commerce reviews which has over 23.000 datas and 10 variables including outfit ID, age, title, review text, rating, recommended status, positive feedback, division name, department name, and class name from the website Kaggle.

# Conclusion
From this project i have concluded that the best performing machine learning algorithms are Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression with the same number accuracy of 88% with overall the best precission, F1-Score, Recall. And the worst peforming algorithm being KNN for conducting a sentiment analysis with a 77% accuracy.
